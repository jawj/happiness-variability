# Happiness variability

These analyses are performed using [Kyle Barron's Stata kernel](https://kylebarron.dev/stata_kernel/) for Jupyter Lab.

You can either download the `.ipynb` file or [view the exported HTML](https://jawj.github.io/happiness-variability/combined_variability_20211214.html) (with table of contents and charts).

The raw data cannot be made public, but aggregated data files (and an amended notebook that makes use of them) will follow.
